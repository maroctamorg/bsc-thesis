\begin{theorem}[Geometric Product of Vectors]\label{t:geometric-product}
	The geometric product between two vectors $u$ and $v$ can be written as the sum of the \textbf{inner product} $u|v$ of $\V$ and a bilinear antisymmetric product which we denote $u\wedge v$ and call \textbf{exterior product}.
\[uv = u|v + u\wedge v\] 
\end{theorem}
