\begin{theorem}[Basis defines the algebra]
    Let $A$ and $B$ be two finite-dimensional algebras.
	A linear map $\varphi: A \to B$ is a homomorphism iff for every element in the basis of $A$:
	\[\varphi(e_ie_j) = \varphi(e_i)\varphi(e_j)\]

	Moreover if $j$ is a one-to-one mapping between bases $\mathcal{B}_A$ and $\mathcal{B}_B$ of their respective algebras, and $j$ commutes with multiplication - there exists one unique such linear map $\varphi: A \to B$ that is an isomorphism and for which $\varphi|_{\mathcal{B}_A} \equiv j$.
\end{theorem}
