    \textbf{Abstract}
	This paper is an introduction to the field of Geometric Algebra. The field - originating in the work of William K. Clifford in the 1800s (thus also known as Clifford Algebra) - has recently been repopularised as a mathematical project, especially with regards to its multitude of applications in physics. Our approach to the subject follows along broad lines that of David Hestenes; we will diverge in our choice of axioms as well as a few definitions: particularly in regards to our strict requirement of an inner product and our limitation to finite-dimensional vector spaces. Our main focus will be in the study of the even subalgebras of the Geometric Algebras of Euclidean Spaces: in particular, we will show that for the 1, 2 and 3 dimensional Euclidean Spaces, these are isomorphic to the Real, Complex and Quaternion algebras respectively. We also show that higher-dimensional algebras are not division algebras, as we would indeed expect since the geometric product is associative and the Euclidean Algebras are finite.
