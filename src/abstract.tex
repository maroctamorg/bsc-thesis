\textbf{Abstract}
	This paper is an introduction to the field of Geometric Algebra. Originating in the work of William K. Clifford in the 1800s (thus also known as Clifford Algebra), the subject has recently been repopularised as a mathematical project, especially with regards to its multitude of applications in physics. Our approach follows along broad lines that of David Hestenes; we will diverge in our choice of axioms as well as a few definitions: particularly in regards to our strict requirement of an inner product and our limitation to finite-dimensional vector spaces. Our main focus will be in the study of the even subalgebras of the geometric algebras of Euclidean spaces: in particular, we will show that for the 1, 2 and 3-dimensional cases, these are isomorphic to the Real, Complex and Quaternion algebras respectively. We also show that higher-dimensional algebras are not division algebras.
