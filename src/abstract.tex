    \textbf{Abstract}
	This paper is an introduction to the field of Geometric Algebra as the proper vector algebra for Euclidean space. The field - though originating in the work of William K. Clifford in the 1800s (thus also known as Clifford Algebra) - has recently been rediscovered, especially with regards to its multitude of applications in physics. Our approach to the subject follows most closely that of David Hestenes', who has been its main proponent; we will diverge slightly in our choice of axioms and a few definitions, though the content is equivalent. Our main focus will be in the study of the even subalgebras of the Geometric Algebras of Euclidean Spaces: in particular, we will show that for the 1, 2 and 3 dimensional Euclidean Spaces, these are isomorphic to the Real, Complex and Quaternion algebras respectively. We also show that higher-dimensional algebras are not division algebras, as we would indeed expect since the geometric product is associative and the Euclidean Algebras are finite.
