\begin{definition}\label{d:outer-product1}
	The outer product $A_r \wedge B_s$ between two homogeneous multivectors $A_r$ and $B_s$ is the highest-possible grade term in their product. We will later see that this is the $\mg{r+s}$-grade term; if the product does not have such a term, then we say that the outer product is 0.
\end{definition}
