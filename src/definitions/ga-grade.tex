\begin{definition}[Grade]
	We introduce the grade operator $\g{A}{k}$ which returns the $k$-grade component of $A$.
	The grade of a multivector $\gr{A} \in \N$ is the grade of the maximum-grade term in $A$.
	We say $A$ is a \textbf{homogeneous} multivector of grade $k$ iff it is a sum of $k$-blades for a given $k \in \N$ (when we wish to make it explicit, we denote it $A_k$); otherwise we say $A$ is of mixed grade.
