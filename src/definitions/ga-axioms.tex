\begin{axiom}\label{a:ga-axiom1}
    $\G$ contains $\R$ as a subalgebra and a real (finite) vector space $\V$ as a subspace; these generate the entire algebra.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}\label{a:ga-axiom2}
	The formal product of a scalar and a vector corresponds with the multiplication by a scalar of the vector space.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}\label{a:ga-axiom3}
    The square of any vector is a real number.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}\label{a:ga-axiom4}
	The formal product on $\V$ is positive-definite, i.e.:
\[\forall v \neq 0 \in \V \quad vv > 0\]
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}\label{a:ga-axiom5}
	The antisymmetrized product of linearly independent vectors	produces an element which does not belong to $\R \bigoplus \V$, we call this product the \textbf{exterior product} and denote it $u \wedge v = \frac{1}{2} (uv - vu)$. 
\end{axiom}
