\begin{axiom}
    $\G$ contains $\R$ as a subalgebra and a real (finite) vector space $\V$ as a subspace; these generate the entire algebra.
\end{axiom}
\begin{axiom}
    The square of any vector is a real number.
\end{axiom}
\begin{axiom}
	The formal product on $\V$ is positive-definite, i.e.:
\[\forall v \neq 0 \in \V \quad vv > 0\]
\end{axiom}
