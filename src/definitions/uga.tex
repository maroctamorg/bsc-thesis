\begin{definition}{The Universal Geometric Algebra}
	The Universal Geometric Algebra is a category of abstract algebras $\G$ satisfying:
	\begin{block}{Axiom 1}
	    $\G$ is a unitary associative algebra.
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{Axiom 2}
	    $\G$ contains $\R$ and the real (finite, abstract) vector space $\V$ as subspaces; these generate the entire algebra.
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{Axiom 3}
	    The square of any vector is a real number.
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{Axiom 4}
	    The symmetrized product on $\V$ is nondegenerate, i.e.:
	    \[vu + uv = 0 \ \forall u \in \V \iff v = 0\]
	\end{block}
\end{definition}
