\begin{definition}[Algebra]\label{d:algebra}
    A real algebra $A$ is a real vector space equipped with a bilinear product; i.e. a set closed under two operations ($+, \cdot: A\times A \to A$) and an action ($*: \R \times A \to A$), with the properties:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item The addition operation is associative, invertible and commutative.
		\item The multiplication by a scalar is associative and distributive with regards to the addition operation.
		\item The product is bilinear:
				\[(a*x + y)\cdot (b*z + t) = ab*xz + a*xt + b*yz + yt\]
	\end{itemize}

%    \[\begin{alignedat}{3}
