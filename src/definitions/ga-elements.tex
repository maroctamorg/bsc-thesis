\begin{definition}[Identities]
    As a unitary algebra, $\G(\V)$ has unique additive and multiplicative identities: $0, 1 \in \R \subset \G(\V)$
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Scalars]
    We refer to reals $a \in \R \subset \G(\V)$ as scalars, or $\textit{grade-0}$ vectors.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[1-vectors]
    Elements $v \in \V \subset \G(\V)$ are called 1-vectors, or simply vectors.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[k-blades] \label{d:k-blades}
Products $e_1e_2 \ldots e_k$ of k anticommuting vectors; we say that a k-blade has grade k. These are also called simple k-vectors.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[k-versors]
Arbitrary products $\bv{v}_1\bv{v}_2 \ldots \bv{v}_k$ of k vectors.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Multivectors]
	Finite sums of versors. By Axiom \ref{a:ga-axiom1}, every element $V \in \G(\V)$ is a multivector. We say $A$ is a \textbf{homogeneous} multivector iff it is a sum of k-blades for a given $k \in \N$; otherwise we say $A$ is of mixed grade.
		We introduce the grade operator $\g{A}{k}$ which returns the k-grade component of $A$.
		The grade of a multivector $\gr{A} \in \N$ is the grade of the maximum-grade term in $A$.
\end{definition}
