\begin{definition}[Homomorphisms]
	An algebra \textbf{homomorphism} is a map between two algebras which preserves their algebraic structure, i.e. $\varphi: A \to B$ s. that $\forall a \in \R$ and $x, y, z \in A$:
    \[\varphi(a*xz+y) = a*\varphi(x)\varphi(z) + \varphi(y)\]
	If the mapping is 1-to-1, we call it an \textbf{isomorphism}.
\end{definition}
