\begin{definition}\label{d:inner-product1}
	The inner product between two homogeneous multivectors $A_r$ and $B_s$ is the lowest-possible grade term in their product. We will later see that this is the $\mg{r-s}$-grade term; if the product does not have such a term, then we say that the inner product is 0.
