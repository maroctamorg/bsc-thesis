\begin{definition}[Exterior Product]\label{d:exterior-product}
	The linear rejection $R(\prod_{i=1}^n, F(\{v_i\}_{i=1}^n))$ of a product with regards to the linear span of its factors is denoted
	\[ \bigwedge_{i=1}^n v_i \equiv v_1 \wedge ... \wedge v_n \]
	We call this exterior (or outer) product.
\end{definition}
