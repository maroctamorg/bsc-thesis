\begin{definition}[Frame]
	The \textbf{frame} of a Geometric Algebra $\G(\V)$ is the basis of $\G(\V)$ as a vector space. It is constructed by taking all product combinations of the vectors in an orthonormal basis for $\V$ where no vector is repeated. Frame elements for a given orthonormal basis are unique up to permutation of factors.
