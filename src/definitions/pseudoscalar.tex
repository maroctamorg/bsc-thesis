\begin{definition}
	The \textbf{pseudoscalar} of a geometric algebra $\G(\V)$ is the highest grade element in its frame. It is unique up to scalar multiplication and including permutation of factors.
	The square of a pseudoscalar is a scalar: by convention, it is normalized such that it squares to $1$ or $-1$ (defining the orientation of the frame).
