\begin{definition}[Pseudoscalar]
	The \textbf{pseudoscalar} of a geometric algebra $\G(\V)$ is the highest grade element in its frame. It is unique up to scalar multiplication (including permutation of factors).
	The square of a pseudoscalar is also a scalar, by convention, it is normalized such that it squares to $1$ or $-1$ (which defines the orientation of the frame).
