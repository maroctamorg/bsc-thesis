\begin{proof}
	Let $n = 4$ and consider the following element
	\[u = e_{12}e_{13}e_{34}\]
	We show that it squares to $1$:
	\begin{align*}
		u^2 = &e_{12}e_{13}e_{34}e_{12}e_{13}e_{34}\\
			= &e_{12}e_{12}e_{13}e_{13}e_{34}e_{34}\\
			= &1
	\end{align*}
	It thus follows that $u^2 - 1 = 0$, by factoring this expression we have found two zero-divisors:
	\begin{align*}
		&u^2 - 1 = (u-1)(u+1) = 0 \\
		&u \pm 1 \neq 0
	\end{align*}
	By Theorem \ref{t:zero-divisor}, $\G_+(\E_4)$ is not a division algebra. Moreover since all higher-dimensional even subalgebras contain $\G(\E_4)$, they all contain the above zero divisors and as such are also not division algebras.
\end{proof}
