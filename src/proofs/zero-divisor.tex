\begin{proof}
	Let $a$ be a zero divisor in an algebra $A$, then $\exists b \neq 0_A \in A$ such that:
	\[ab = 0_A\]
	Assume $a$ has an inverse in $A$, then:
	\[a^{-1}ab = a^{-1}0_A \Leftrightarrow b = 0_A\]
	This contradicts our premises, and so we have proven that $a$ has no inverse in $A$ and thus $A$ is not a division algebra.
\end{proof}
