\begin{proof}
	Let $u$ and $v \in \V$, we may expand the two vectors in an orthogonal basis $\{e_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and separate their product into a symmetric and antisymmetric part using bilinearity:
	\begin{align*}
		uv &= \left(\sum_i \alpha_ie_i \right)\left(\sum_j \beta_je_j \right) \\
		   &= \sum_{i} (\alpha_i\beta_i)e_ie_i + \sum_{i \neq j} (\alpha_i\beta_j)e_ie_j \\
		   &= u|v + u\wedge v
	\end{align*}
	Where in the last step we have made the following observations:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item since the product $e_ie_i$ corresponds to the inner product $e_i|e_i$ by Axiom \ref{a:ga-axiom3}, it follows directly that the symmetric part of the sum is the inner product of $u$ and $v$ in $\V$.

		\item the antisymmetric sum is a linear combination of products of orthogonal vectors; by Axiom \ref{a:freest}, we obtain that it is indeed a bilinear antisymmetric product and identify this with the exterior product $u\wedge v$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
