\begin{proof}
	PROBLEM: exterior product is currently defined in terms of geometric product only for two vectors...
	Let $\{v_i\}_{i=1}^n$ be a linearly dependent set of vectors, i.e.:
	\[\exists \{\alpha_i\}_{i=1}^{n-1} : v_n \equiv \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \alpha_i v_i\]
	Then, consider their outer product and recall bilinearity and antisymmetry:
	\begin{align*}
		\bigwedge_{i=1}^n v_i &= v_1 \wedge ... \wedge \sum{i=1}^{n-1} \alpha_i v_i \\
		&= (\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n-1} v_i) \
\end{proof}
