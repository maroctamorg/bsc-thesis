\begin{proof}
	Consider the following expression, and recall Axiom \ref{a:ga-axiom3}:
    \begin{align*}
        &(u+v)^2 = u^2 + v^2 + uv + vu \Leftrightarrow \\
        &2u|v = (u+v)^2 - u^2 - v^2 \in \R
    \end{align*}
	So the symmetrized product maps into $\R$ (i.e. $| : \V \times \V \to \R$). By Definition \ref{d:algebra}, the geometric product is bilinear and so is the symmetrized product as it is a linear function of the bilinear products; moreover, by Axiom \ref{a:ga-axiom4}, it is also positive-definite. We conclude that $u|v = uv + vu$ is indeed an inner product on $\V$.
