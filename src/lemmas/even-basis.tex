\begin{lemma}
	Let $\G$ be a geometric algebra with basis $\{e_1, e_2, \ldots e_n\}$.
	Its even subalgebra $\G_+$ is generated by the set of unit bivectors $\{e_1e_2, \ldots e_1e_n, e_2e_3 \ldots e_{n-1}e_n\}$; we will make use of the following shortened notation: $e_ie_j = e_{ij}$.

	The unit bivectors have the following basic properties:
	\begin{align*}
%		e_{ii} &= 0 \\
		e_{ij} &= -e_{ji} \\
		{e_{ij}}^2 &= -1 \\
	\end{align*}
	Moreover, it follows from straightforward algebraic manipulations that the product of two unit bivectors anti-commutes if they share a common index and commutes otherwise.
