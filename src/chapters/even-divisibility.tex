\section{Euclidean Even Geometric Subalgebras}

We will follow the approach laid out in the previous section in order to construct the Geometric Algebra of the 1, 2 and 3 dimensional Euclidean spaces, and consider their even subalgebras.
The main result of this section will be our proof that these are isomorphic to the well-known scalar algerbras $\R, \C \mathrm{\ and\ } \HM$.

\subsubsection{$\G(\E_1)\ \mathrm{and}\ \G_+(\E_1)$}

$\G(\E_1)$  is trivial, it corresponds to the algebra $\R$ over itself: the scalar and bilinear multiplications are one and the same; the inner product is simply given by the magnitude of the standard product (i.e. $a | b = \mg{ab}$); and the basis is just $\{1\}$.

It follows that its even subalgebra is itself, and thus clearly isomorphic to $\R$.

\subsubsection{$\G(\E_2)\ \mathrm{and}\ \G_+(\E_2)$}

$\E_2$ is the standard euclidean plane. We denote its orthonormal basis $\{\bv{e}_1, \bv{e}_2\}$ and work out its multiplication table:
\input{src/tables/multiplication-table-2a}

It is clear then that the basis of the algebra $\G(\E_2)$ is simply $\{1, \bv{e}_1, \bv{e_2}, \bv{e}_1\bv{e_2}\}$; the even subalgebra $\G_+(\E_2)$ is thus generated by $\{1, \bv{e}_1\bv{e_2} \}$, and it becomes clear that the mapping $\bv{e}_1\bv{e_2} \leftrightarrow i$ induces an isomorphism $j : \G(\E_2) \leftrightarrow \C$ by comparing multiplication tables:
\input{src/tables/multiplication-table-2b}

\subsubsection{$\G(\E_3)\ \mathrm{and}\ \G_+(\E_3)$}
$\E_3$ is the standard euclidean space. We denote its orthonormal basis $\{\bv{e}_1, \bv{e}_2\, \bv{e}_3\}$.

The basis of the algebra $\G(\E_3)$ is simply $\{1, \bv{e}_1, \bv{e}_2, \bv{e}_3, \bv{e}_1\bv{e}_2, \bv{e}_2\bv{e}_3, \bv{e}_1\bv{e}_3, \bv{e}_1\bv{e}_2\bv{e}_3\}$; the even subalgebra $\G_+(\E_3)$ is thus generated by the set $\{1, \bv{e}_1\bv{e}_2, \bv{e}_2\bv{e}_3, \bv{e}_1\bv{e}_3\}$; by observing its multiplication table (Table \ref{ta:mt3}), it becomes clear that the mapping
\begin{align*}
	&\bv{e}_1\bv{e}_2 \leftrightarrow i \\
	&\bv{e}_2\bv{e}_3 \leftrightarrow j \\
	&\bv{e}_1\bv{e}_3 \leftrightarrow k 
\end{align*}
induces an isomorphism $j : \G(\E_3) \leftrightarrow \HM$.

\section{The Geometric Isomorphism Theorem of Scalar Algebras}

% \subsection{Non-divisibility of $\G_+(\E_n)$ for $n > 3$}

We have seen that for $n \in \{1, 2, 3\}$, the even subalgebras $\G_+(\E_n)$ are isomorphic to division algebras. The following lemma shows that for $n > 3$, this is no longer the case.

\input{src/lemmas/nondivisibility}
\input{src/proofs/nondivisibility}

Finally, we are able to prove the Frobenius Classification of Finite-Dimensional Associative Division Algebras over the Reals.
