\section{Even Subalgebras}
We start off with a discussion on the construction of even subalgebras and introduce some notation and results that will be of use in the next section.

An even subalgebra is constructed from its basis precisely in the same manner as a geometric algebra, however its basis is distinct from that of the original algebra.

This is made explicit in the following self-evident lemma:
\input{src/lemmas/even-basis}
We will make use of the above properties in computation, without explicit mention.

\section{Euclidean Geometric Algebras}
We will follow the approach laid out in the previous section in order to construct the Geometric Algebra of the 1, 2 and 3 dimensional Euclidean spaces and consider their even subalgebras.
The main result of this chapter will be our proof that these are isomorphic to the well-known scalar algerbras $\R, \C \mathrm{\ and\ } \HM$.

\subsection{$\G(\E_1)\ \mathrm{and}\ \G_+(\E_1)$}

We define the 1-dimensional Euclidean space as follows in order to distinguish it from the real numbers:
\[\E_1 \equiv \{\alpha e_1 | \alpha \in \R\} \sim \R\]
$\G(\E_1)$  is trivial: its frame is just $\{1, e_1\}$.
It follows that its even subalgebra has frame $\{1\}$ and thus corresponds to $\R$.

\subsection{$\G(\E_2)\ \mathrm{and}\ \G_+(\E_2)$}

$\E_2$ is the standard euclidean plane. We denote its orthonormal basis $\{e_1, e_2\}$ and work out its multiplication table with respect to the geometric product:
\input{src/tables/multiplication-table-2a}

The frame of $\G(\E_2)$ is simply $\{1, e_1, e_2, e_1e_2\}$, and the even subalgebra $\G_+(\E_2)$ is thus generated by $\{1, e_1e_2 \}$.
It is apparent that the mapping $e_1e_2 \leftrightarrow i$ induces an isomorphism $j : \G(\E_2) \leftrightarrow \C$ by comparing multiplication tables:
\input{src/tables/multiplication-table-2b}

\subsection{$\G(\E_3)\ \mathrm{and}\ \G_+(\E_3)$}
$\E_3$ is the standard euclidean space. We denote its orthonormal basis $\{e_1, e_2\, e_3\}$.

The frame of $\G(\E_3)$ is simply $\{1, e_1, e_2, e_3, e_{12}, e_{23}, e_{13}, e_{12}e_3\}$; the even subalgebra $\G_+(\E_3)$ is thus generated by the set $\{1, e_{12}, e_{23}, e_{13}\}$; by observing its multiplication table (Table \ref{ta:mt3}), it becomes clear that the mapping
\begin{align*}
	&e_{12} \leftrightarrow i \\
	&e_{23} \leftrightarrow j \\
	&e_{13} \leftrightarrow k 
\end{align*}
induces an isomorphism $j : \G(\E_3) \leftrightarrow \HM$.

\input{src/tables/multiplication-table-3}

We conclude with the following lemma which shows that for $n > 3$, the even subalgebras are no longer division algebras.
