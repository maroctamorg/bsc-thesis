\section{Abstract Algebra: A Brief Primer}\label{s:algebra}
In this section we will go over background definitions and results which will be of use in the subsequent chapters of the thesis.

We say that an algebra is \textbf{associative} when its multiplication is associative: in this thesis, we will always be dealing with real, associative algebras (unless otherwise mentioned).

The latter part of the above theorem allows us to simply compare multiplication tables for the basis elements of two finite-dimensional algebras in order to determine whether they are isomorphic. We say that the mapping $j$ induces the isomorphism $\varphi$.
