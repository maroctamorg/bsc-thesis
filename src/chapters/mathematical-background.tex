\section{Abstract Algebra: A Brief Primer}\label{s:algebra}
In this section we will go over background definitions and results which will be of use in the subsequent chapters of the thesis.

We say that an algebra is \textbf{associative} when its multiplication is associative; an algebra is \textbf{unital} if its multiplication has an identity element in the algebra (for an algebra $A$, we denote this element $1_A$): in this thesis (unless otherwise mentioned), we will be dealing with real associative unital algebras.

\begin{remark}
	The latter part of the above theorem allows us to simply compare products of the basis elements of two finite-dimensional algebras in order to determine whether they are isomorphic. We say that the mapping $j$ induces the isomorphism $\varphi$.
