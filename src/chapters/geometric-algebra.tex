\section{The Universal Geometric Algebra}

The fundamental concept in Geometric Algebra is that of the \textbf{Universal Geometric Algebra} (UGA for short). It is usually formulated as an infinite-dimensional abstract algebra obeying a certain set of axioms, within which all the Geometric Algebras are contained \cite{ga-origin}. 

I have not been able to convince myself that the standard formulation is justified without addressing the peculiarities of infinite-dimensional inner product spaces; so we shall do otherwise, and define it as follows:
\begin{definition}[Universal Geometric Algebra]
	The \textbf{Universal Geometric Algebra} is a family of algebras obeying a specific set of axioms. Its elements (the Geometric or Clifford Algebras) are specified by the choice of a finite-dimensional inner product space over the reals.
\end{definition}

A \textbf{UGA} is then a template for Geometric Algebras: given a finite-dimensional linear space, and an inner product, there exists a unique axiom-abiding algebra which contains the linear space and whose symmetrized product corresponds to the prescribed inner product.

A note on nomenclature is urgently in order: what we call \textbf{Universal Geometric Algebra} is in fact not an algebra; we will continue to refer to it as such, and in fact we will discuss the generally applicable definitions and results in the context of an abstract algebra whose formal product obeys the axioms, and whose abstract linear space will always be assumed to be of a sufficiently high-dimension such that it does not get in the way of the argument.

\section{Axioms and Elements}

The Geometric Algebra $\G$ of a finite-dimensional inner product space $\V$ is the 'freest' (i.e. the most general) unitary associative algebra over the reals obeying the following axioms:
\input{src/definitions/ga-axioms}
We refer to the product of such an algebra as a \textbf{geometric product}.

Immediate results of Axiom \ref{a:ga-axiom3} are:
\input{src/lemmas/invertibility}

\input{src/lemmas/inner-product}
\input{src/proofs/inner-product}

%We have seen that $\R \bigoplus \V$ is closed under the symmetric part of the product; the algebra must thus be generated by the antisymmetric part of the product:
%\input{src/definitions/exterior-product}

We have observed that the axioms place a restriction on the symmetric part of the product between two vectors. The antisymmetric part, on the other hand, bears no restriction: since the Geometric Algebra is the most general algebra obeying the axioms, we identify this part of the product with the freest bilinear and antisymmetric product, we call it the \textbf{exterior} product. We thus obtain the principal property of the geometric product.
\input{src/theorems/geometric-product}
\input{src/proofs/geometric-product}

As a corollary, we obtain the following self-evident propositions.
%\input{src/corollaries/l-independence}
%\input{src/proofs/l-independence}
\input{src/corollaries/orthogonality}
\input{src/corollaries/orthonormal-bases}

Before we make some final remarks about existence, uniqueness and construction, we ought to familiarise ourselves with some specific terminology.
\input{src/definitions/ga-elements}

A critical lemma to which we will often make implicit reference is the following:
\input{src/lemmas/ga-expansion}
\input{src/proofs/ga-expansion}

We are now justified in presenting the following definition:
\input{src/definitions/ga-grade.tex}

A brief note on conventions: here on out, whenever left unspecified, the precedence of products is inner$\to$wedge$\to$geometric.

\section{Products}
We will now go on to consider general expressions and properties of products between arbitrary multivectors.
First off, we generalize the definition of the inner and outer products to homogeneous multivectors.
\input{src/definitions/g-inner-product1}
\input{src/definitions/g-outer-product1}

We now prove the following lemma regarding the product of a vector with a homogenous multivector.
\input{src/lemmas/v-mv-product}
\input{src/proofs/v-mv-product}

The above proof is due to \textit{Hestenes} (p. 8-10)\cite{ga-origin}

Using the above lemma, we can prove the following important property of the geometric product between homogeneous multivectors.
\input{src/theorems/homogeneous-product}
\input{src/proofs/homogeneous-product}

The above proof is due to \textit{Chisolm} (p. 20-21)\cite{ga-chisolm}

As a corollary, we obtain our sought-after result.
\input{src/corollaries/even-subalgebra}


Moreover, we are now equipped to provide general, explicit definitions for the inner and outer products in the case of arbitrary multivectors.
\input{src/definitions/g-inner-product2}
\input{src/definitions/g-outer-product2}

\section{Bases and Frames}\label{s:bases-frames}

A Geometric Algebra is only realized into a concrete algebra once an inner-product space is specified. It is then straightforward to construct the whole algebra given a basis for the inner-product space. But first, we need some specific terminology.

\input{src/definitions/basis}
\input{src/definitions/frame}
\input{src/definitions/pseudoscalar}

The distinction between basis and frame is very important: a frame is to a basis, as a geometric algebra is to its generating vector space.
For finite-dimensional spaces, we can always produce an orthonormal basis by the Gran-Schmidt process, so we will henceforth assume all bases to be orthonormal unless otherwise specified.

A frame can be identified one-to-one with the power set of a basis, as it is composed of all the possible combinations of the basis elements without repetition and up to permutation (we identify the unit scalar in the frame with the empty subset of the basis). It follows that the dimension of a geometric algebra $\G$ (as a vector space) is $2^{\gr{\G}}$.

The recipe for constructing a Geometric Algebra is thus, as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item construct an orthonormal basis for the inner-product space: this will be the basis of the algebra
	\item construct the frame of the algebra by taking products between non-repeating unit vectors
	\item generate the rest of the algebra as a vector space with the frame as its basis
\end{enumerate}

% With the above terminology we can also straightforwardly prove the Universal Property of a Geometric Algebra.
