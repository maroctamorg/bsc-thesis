BUILD
-----
With `latexmk` installed (e.g. via TeXLive) simply run `make compile` in the project root.
To compile and open the pdf from the command line, run
```sh
PDFVIEWER={PDFVIEWER} make
```
Often it is possible to pass `open` or `xdg-open` to the PDFVIEWER as it calls the DE-specific pdfviewer.
