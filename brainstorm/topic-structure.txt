STRUCTURE	:
	ABSTRACT
	INTRODUCTION
	BACKGROUND
		Groups, Rings and Fields: definitions, homomorphisms, equivalence relations, quotients? and ideals?, divisibility
		Vector Spaces and Algebras: definitions, uniqueness of finite-dimensional vector spaces, free algebras and bases, structure constants?, tensor algebra?
	GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA
		overview of the Universal Geometric Algebra and its relationship to Clifford Algebras: axioms, elements, products, UGA as a template, Clifford Algebras, formal? and practical construction
		Clifford/Geometric Algebras of Euclidean Space and their even subalgebras (G+(E1), G+(E2), G+(E3), G+(E4))
	DIVISIBILITY OF EVEN SUBALGEBRAS AND PROOF OF FROBENIUS
		even subalgebras: proof of non-divisibility of G+(En) for n>3 (construction of zero-divisor: simple but original)
		unital associative finite-dimension division algebras over the reals (proof of isomorphism to G+(En): either standard in the language of GA or original (if I can come up with one))
	CONCLUSION
