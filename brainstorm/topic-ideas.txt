 - Overview of Geometric Algebra [and Calculus]
	TOPICS		: Geometric Algebra, Geometric Calculus
	CATEGORY	: Presentation of a concept
	PROS		: simpler, quicker, more rigorous, more space for me to discuss the philosophy and advantages of the theory, analyse original or ambiguous definitions thoroughly (justify different choice/presentation of axioms, discuss alternative definitions for vector manifolds)
	CONS		: less focused
	SUBTOPICS	: geometric algebra from axioms vs. as quotient structure on the tensor algebra, universal property of geometric algebra, classification and properties of elements and products, [geometric derivative, properties of the geometric derivative, gradient-divergence-curl, exterior derivative, directed integration]
	REFINEMENTS	: - proof of the universal property of geometric algebras (starting from axioms)
				  - construction of a geometric algebra of smooth curves or a geometric tangent structure (from the local embedding into a geometric euclidean algebra induce a geometric product on the tangent vectors): prove that connections and tensors are elements of the geometric tangent structure

 - Generalized Stoke's Theorem
	TOPICS		: Geometric Algebra, Geometric Calculus, Vector Manifolds, Directed Integration
	PROS		: solid, straightforward
	CONS		: vector manifolds are somewhat underdeveloped as a concept: the original formulation seems to require an embedding of a smooth manifold into a Geometric Algebra (points are geometric vectors) so it may be needed to invoke the Whitney embedding theorem to justify generalizability; alternatively, I would need to do some further research and be very careful in reformulating the theory in terms of local embeddings (charts map neighborhoods of M into the geometric algebra of E_n)
